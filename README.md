## How it works:

The project has frontend and backend

1. Any one can visit the website and go through the bicycle listings and check detail page.
2. If any user wants to buy a product he/she needs to login first if registered already. if not registered then he/she needs to register first and then login to buy. 
3. Once the order is placed he/she will be diverted to payment page where he/she can pay by card through stripe.
